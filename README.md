# StarGen PHP

## Overview
StarGen PHP is an open-source project designed to generate dynamic, visually appealing starfields and nebulae images using SVG format. Inspired by the beauty of the deep field images from Hubble and JWST, this project uses PHP to create complex starfields that include randomly placed stars, galaxies, and nebula-like formations, mimicking the deep field images captured by telescopes like Hubble.

## Features
- **Dynamic Starfields**: Generates unique starfields every time the script is run.
- **Customizable Parameters**: Users can adjust the density of stars and galaxies, as well as the color schemes used for different celestial objects.
- **SVG Output**: The output is in SVG format, making it scalable and suitable for various applications including web backgrounds, scientific illustrations, and more.
